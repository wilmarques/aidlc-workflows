// t151-onboarding-skeleton: the shared onboarding-doc skeleton renders a
// COMPLETE doc for every harness — including a brand-new one — from one source.
//
// covers: file:scripts/onboarding.ts
//
// WHAT. core/templates/onboarding.md + scripts/onboarding.ts render each
// harness's CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md. This pins the "a 4th harness gets a complete
// onboarding doc for free, provably" guarantee:
//   (1) renderOnboarding() over a SYNTHETIC 4th harness's fills produces a doc
//       with every shared section present, the invoke command substituted, and
//       NO leftover {{SLOT:...}} / {{INVOKE}} marker — i.e. nothing was forgotten.
//   (2) An incomplete fill set (a declared slot left unprovided that the renderer
//       fails to blank) cannot pass — the renderer THROWS. We assert the
//       completeness guard fires on a deliberately-broken skeleton.
//   (3) Each manifest-discovered shipped harness renders with zero leftover
//       markers via its real fills, and its projected onboarding file exists.
//
// Mechanism: none. Pure in-process render over the skeleton + fills modules.
// Zero spawn, zero LLM, zero tokens.
