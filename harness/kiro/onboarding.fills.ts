This project uses AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle) for structured development, running on the **Kiro CLI harness**. The workspace shell ships in \`.kiro/\` (no setup command); describe what you want to build and it sets up the workflow for you. Run \`/aidlc\` followed by a scope or project description to begin. Run \`/aidlc --doctor\` to validate your setup, \`/aidlc --version\` to print the framework version, \`/aidlc --stage <slug>\` to jump to a specific stage, \`/aidlc --phase <name>\` to jump to a phase, \`/aidlc --depth <level>\` to override depth, \`/aidlc --test-strategy <level>\` to override test volume, \`/aidlc --review <class>\` to cap stage reviews (adversarial, advisory, none). Run \`/aidlc compose "<task>"\` to get a plan tailored to that task (works up front, from a scan report via \`--report <path>\`, and mid-workflow to re-shape the pending stages - every proposal stops at an approve/edit/reject gate).`,

    prereq_bullets: `- **Kiro CLI ≥ 2.6**: the hooks/skills/agent features this install relies on (stop hook with blocking, preToolUse/postToolUse matchers, \`.kiro/skills/\` slash commands, workspace \`chat.defaultAgent\`) shipped in the 2.x line. Check with \`kiro-cli --version\`.
- **bun**: Required for the CLI tools and hook scripts (tracking progress, writing the decision log, deciding what runs next). Install via \`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash\`. \`bun\` must be on your PATH for the non-interactive shells the harness spawns — these source \`~/.zshenv\` (zsh) or \`~/.bashrc\` (bash), NOT \`~/.zshrc\`.
- **Activation**: this install ships \`.kiro/settings/cli.json\` setting \`chat.defaultAgent: "aidlc"\`, so a plain \`kiro-cli chat\` in this project uses the AI-DLC agent and \`/aidlc\` just works. **Note: the workspace default takes precedence over any global default agent you have configured.** If you prefer your own default, delete that settings line and start sessions with \`kiro-cli chat --agent aidlc\` instead.
- **Permissions**: the \`aidlc\` agent pre-approves ONLY project-relative \`bun .kiro/tools/<tool>.ts\` calls (including the \`bun run\` and quoted-path spellings), \`date -u\`, and its listed read-only native tools; everything else prompts. There is no blanket shell trust. Start Kiro from the project root so those relative tool paths resolve correctly. In \`--no-interactive\` runs, a command that would prompt is refused because no approver is present. \`--trust-all-tools\` bypasses the deny list too; use it only in a disposable sandbox.`,

    agents_note: `On Kiro the \`/aidlc\` session runs from \`agents/aidlc.json\`; all 14 expert roles have JSON configs, and the four delegated stages (2.1 pipeline, 2.2 subagent, 2.4 mob, 3.5 subagent), reviewer passes, and composer requests run through the Kiro \`subagent\` tool, while inline-stage personas are adopted in-context.`,

    sections_before_resumption: `## What's different on this harness

This is the same AI-DLC core that ships to every harness: the same ordered steps, the same approval gates, and the same written record of what was decided, rendered onto Kiro CLI. On Kiro:

- Approval gates and questions render as **numbered prose options** (no structured-question widget); the questions FILE with \`[Answer]:\` tags remains the source of truth.
- There is **no statusline** and **no welcome message**; use \`/aidlc --status\` and the progress lines at gates.
- Construction swarm runs as **subagent fan-out only** (\`AIDLC_USE_SWARM=1\` is a loud no-op).
- Session-end and pre-compaction audit events (\`SESSION_ENDED\`, \`SESSION_COMPACTED\`) are not emitted — Kiro has no hooks for those moments.
- **MCP servers**: five ship in \`.kiro/settings/mcp.json\`, all disabled by default. Flip \`"disabled": false\` on each server you want to enable. Context7 is keyless on Kiro because Kiro sends configured HTTP header values verbatim instead of expanding environment placeholders. All 14 delegated personas opt in through \`includeMcpJson: true\` plus \`@<server>\` tool grants; the conductor gets none.
- A workflow's \`aidlc/\` workspace tree is harness-neutral: a project can move between Claude Code and Kiro CLI installs (supported but untested — keep both \`.claude/\` and \`.kiro/\` in sync via the framework's packaging if you do this).
