// harness/devin/manifest.ts — the Devin CLI distribution row.
//
// One core, N harnesses (dist-unified). This manifest tells scripts/package.ts
// how to project the harness-neutral core/ tree into dist/devin/.devin/:
//   - the harness directory token substitution ({{HARNESS_DIR}} → .devin)
//   - the per-dir map (core/<src> → <harnessDir>/<dst>); Devin renames nothing
//   - which authored files live in harness/devin/ and where they land
//
// Devin is a peer harness, not the identity transform: its prose carries the
// same {{HARNESS_DIR}} token as every other harness; the packager substitutes
// `.devin` here. Devin is authored-files-only like Claude (no emit()): every
// harness-specific surface (the stdin adapter shim, hooks.v1.json wiring,
// config.json permissions, mcp_config.json, the rules/aidlc.md auto-load stub,
// the orchestrator SKILL.md) is a hand-authored harnessFile copied verbatim
// (with token substitution on .md). The plugin projection is omitted so the
// packager derives the default `.devin-plugin` + `kind:"store"` (Devin's native
// plugin format).

  // R4: every generated stage/scope runner is user-only on Devin. Devin's
  // `triggers:` frontmatter field gates who can invoke a skill: `[user]` means
  // only an explicit user command (e.g. `/aidlc-code-generation`) fires it,
  // never a model-initiated call. Mutating runners (init, compose, every stage
  // and scope runner) must not be model-invocable, or an agent could bypass
  // the orchestrator's approval gates by self-dispatching a stage. The
  // packager persists this in tools/data/harness.json so runner regeneration
  // during plugin composition applies the same policy. Inline list syntax
  // (`[user]`) keeps the value on one line — the harness.json validator
  // requires each entry to be a YAML key line.
